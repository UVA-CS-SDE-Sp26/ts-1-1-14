Pseudocode:


-Setup:
    - 1st, when provided the key file, store the 1st line as a string named as normalKey
    - 2nd, when provided the key file, store the 2nd line as a string named as cypherKey


- Method:
    - decryptCharacter: this method will decrypt a single character with a return type of char. To do this, it will take
    in the character intended to by decrypted (variable named as encryptedCharacter), the normalKey, and the cypherKey.
    Then cypherKey.indexOf(encryptedCharacter) will be used to extract the index of the encrypted character and stored
    into the variable indexLocation. Next, normalKey.charAt(indexLocation) will be used to find the decrypted character that
    corresponds with the encrypted one.
        - *** Note: Because this method only decrypts a single character at a time, a loop will be needed to decrypt
        blocks of text. This would be easiest with a mutable string (StringBuilder) and .append()

 - Exceptions:
    - If the two cyphers are not the same length, then that means that we were given incomplete information. It may be
    worth checking if the same characters are in both strings provided.
    - We may be asked to decrypt a character that was not included in either key (like punctuation and such). We would
    need to handle that error.
